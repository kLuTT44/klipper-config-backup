# Probe offset = -20.85 on the Y
screw1: 27.3,183.75
#   The (X, Y) coordinate of the first bed leveling screw. This is a
#   position to command the nozzle to so that the probe is directly
#   above the bed screw (or as close as possible while still being
#   above the bed). This is the base screw used in calculations. This
#   parameter must be provided.
screw1_name: BackRightScrew
#   An arbitrary name for the given screw. This name is displayed when
#   the helper script runs. The default is to use a name based upon
#   the screw XY location.
screw2: 27.3,3.75
screw2_name: FrontRightScrew

screw3: 207.3,3.75
screw3_name: FrontLeftScrew

screw4: 207.3,183.75
screw4_name: BackLeftScrew

screw5: 149.8,93.75
screw5_name: MidLeft

screw6: 84.8,93.75
screw6_name: MidRight

speed: 90
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
horizontal_move_z: 15
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
screw_thread: CCW-M4
#   The type of screw used for bed leveling, M3, M4, or M5, and the
#   rotation direction of the knob that is used to level the bed.
#   Accepted values: CW-M3, CCW-M3, CW-M4, CCW-M4, CW-M5, CCW-M5.
#   Default value is CW-M3 which most printers use. A clockwise
#   rotation of the knob decreases the gap between the nozzle and the
#   bed. Conversely, a counter-clockwise rotation increases the gap.
